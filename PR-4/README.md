# OOP Projects README

Welcome to the OOP Projects repository! This collection of projects demonstrates the application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles using Python. Each project is designed to illustrate key OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. Below is a description of the projects included in this repository.

## To-Do List

### Description

The To-Do List project is a simple application that allows users to manage their tasks. This project demonstrates the use of classes to create and manage tasks, providing functionality to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete.

### Features

- Add new tasks
- Delete existing tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- View all tasks

### OOP Concepts

- **Class and Object**: Task class representing individual tasks.
- **Encapsulation**: Task properties and methods are encapsulated within the Task class.
- **Inheritance**: Base class for task management that can be extended for more complex task management systems.

## Calculator

### Description

The Calculator project is a basic calculator application that performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project showcases the use of classes and methods to perform these operations.

### Features

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

### OOP Concepts

- **Class and Object**: Calculator class for performing arithmetic operations.
- **Encapsulation**: Arithmetic methods are encapsulated within the Calculator class.

## Palindrome Checker

### Description

The Palindrome Checker project is a simple application that checks whether a given string is a palindrome. This project highlights the use of OOP to structure the palindrome checking logic.

### Features

- Check if a string is a palindrome
- Case insensitive checking

### OOP Concepts

- **Class and Object**: PalindromeChecker class to encapsulate the palindrome checking logic.
- **Encapsulation**: Methods to check for palindromes are encapsulated within the PalindromeChecker class.
