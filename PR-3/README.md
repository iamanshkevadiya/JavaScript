Age Calculator: Calculates a person's age based on their date of birth.
BMI Calculator: Computes the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a person's weight and height.
EMI Calculator: Calculates the Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) for a loan based on the principal amount, interest rate, and loan tenure.
